What drives someone to bully a kid? They must have their own mental issues as well that may need to be tended to. I would say it hits me harder while watching a movie over reading a book. You can hear more introspective thoughts while reading a book. A movie, all you see is what is on the outside unless the character is narrating themselves.

Normally when there is offensive portrayal of someone it is tied into the plot of the story. If there were to be offensive portrayal of someone for no rythme or reason then it may be difficult for me to watch.

For example, people wishing to mountain climb must learn proper techniques, invest in proper equipment, and even train on less tasking mountains before tackling more dangerous and demanding climbs. The same is true for other extreme sports. As for when a sport becomes unreasonable or still within reason depends primarily on the person, specifically their skill, physique, and mindset.

{"text": "One of the main reasons i believe is just for that adrenaline rush or thrill. That rush is something that is more than likely thereapeutic to them. The feeling of bliss when all you are focused on is just climbing that rock, the reason being if you fall you are probably going to be seriously injured or die. I can really understand someone who is doing it for this reason because it is a way to control your mental. I have participated in sports all my life as well, and i know for a fact it is what kept my mental sane. As soon as i stopped playing football after college, i had a huge missing gap in my life. One that i had from the age of 8 all the way through 22. I have learned so much about myself and know that i needed to find that another sport that gave me that feeling. This caused me to get into boxing. Boxing gave me the same sort of adrenaline that cleared my mind and made me feel good and happy. Me personally, I would so much rather do something dangerous and scary than to be in my own head and be upset or depressed. I would rather sky dive from a plane, climb a mountain, fight a boxing match, or even run into a burning building than being in my own head and upset. So someone who does mountain climbing for the mental part of it directly correlates to my life directly. I dont think any sort of line can be drawn for what is reasonable and not because it is completely up to that person. Whether this person is a father of four, or a twenty year old with no kids. If this person is doing the sport for a mental benefit, or benefit of any kind, i think it is not selfish. A clear head is what ultimately allows someone to be the best version of themselves. Us making the decision on what someone can and can not do because it is deemed selfish, completely takes that choice away from the individuals. So in conclusion, i feel that it is not selfish to pursue risky sports likee extreme mountain climbing.

The argument that they are getting a scholarship which is a payment is a ridiculous one to me. Sure they are getting a scholarship. They also are working much harder than the typical student. Student athletes are basically being a full time student and a full time athlete at the same time. Thankfully, a bill was just passed that allows students to make money off of their name and their likeness. I would be willing to bet than an athlete like Zion Williamson made Duke at least 20 times the amount that his scholarship was. The student athletes have simply been exploited by colleges in the past, and the only people who see no issues with that are the universities themselves. The entire student athletes getting a scholarship thing is a scam. It's just a scam that the universities and the top 1%  push because it helps make them money. Paying student athletes would not destroy college sports. Would it have an effect on the sports economy? Sure. Instead of the universities and networks keeping 100% of the profits and getting rich off of the student athletes, they'll have to give them their fair share. Anyone who disagrees with students not getting paid for sports simply wants to exploit them. There is no reason why a student should be risking injury before they go pro for a university for free. I don't want to hear the scholarship excuse. Students could have a full ride for academics. Then what happens to those students? They get a full ride for academics and them playing sports gets them nothing extra? Maybe a free textbook or free lunches from the school cafeteria? We have finally figured out that this scam has been going on for too long and that is why the lawmakers made a change. The exploitation of these 18-22 year old men and women is disgusting. I'm extremely happy that it is changing. There have been so many student athletes in the past that have been used by their university. If people ever saw the amount of money that Alabama makes from their football program, their jaws would drop. That goes the same for Duke and North Carolina for basketball. That goes for basically all of the SEC and ACC teams in college football. There is enough money being made off of the college athletes to spread the wealth. I do think there should be a cap on it and/or there should be a GPA to maintain in order to get their payments. If they fall below a 2.0 GPA for example they get fined or something along those lines to teach them the consequences of slacking off. Most college athletes won't go pro so they still need to make sure their academics are a priority. As long as their grades are in good standing, they should get their payments.

{"text": "I say this because i dont feel we are ignoring human suffering. I think that there is just so much human suffering that we need to pick and choose where to divert our attention to. Likewise with animals, there are many animals that suffer on our planet. I think there needs to be some sort of moderation on both since it is unrealistic to think we can combat all suffering in both categories. In addition to that, i think the media has sort of desensitized human suffering since it is so common. For this reason, we as humans have more of a emotional reaction when we see animals being taken advantage of over humans. We understand that both are wrong, however we see it so often for humans that we sort of just repress it in a way. I think that emotional reaction is still there if we see a kid being harmed, however a grown adult we just sort of brush aside. As far as the 40 percent saving their dog over a tourist, i think i would have to agree. Our dog is like family, so if there was a life to save i would probably go with my dog. I would not really be super sad if something happened to the tourist, simply because i do not know them personally. If something happened to my dog i would be extremely upset and saddened. Its an easy choice for me, but i would just relate it to family over non family. So being more empathetic to suffering animals is really just something that society has done to us in a way i guess. It would be interesting to find out how humans would react to stimuli involing a human death and animal death, if they had grown up in an era with no media aside from writing. Maybe the reaction would be higher for humans because they can relate to a human death more. I dont find it wrong either way to focus on welfare of animals or humans, because if that is what your focused on that you are an empathetic individual. Everyone's perspective is different and what may cause one person to take the death of a human strongly, may not do the same to someone else. This is the beauty in everyone being different, and having had different experiences. Just from my own perspective, i think i would probably have the stronger reaction seeing a dog being beat by a bat over an adult. But if it was a child instead i think the child would take the cake over an animal, but thats just me.

{"text": "Technology allows us to communicate with our significant other no matter where we are in the world. Inventions such as FaceTime allow for long distance relationships to not feel so distant. Technology has also given us dating apps and websites such as Tinder and Bumble where many people have met their boyfriend, girlfriend, wife or husband. These apps help take the stress and anxiety away from meeting someone for the first time. You can ease into a 'relationship' by talking online with someone first. This allows you to get to know someone and get information on whether you are most likely compatible with them or not. Technology has personally helped me when it comes to dating. I have used Tinder a couple of times and actually found my current girlfriend on there. I feel like it's a very easy way to break the ice and let someone know that you're interested in them. All you have to do is swipe right and they know you're at least interesting in speaking to them. To me, technology takes a lot of the nerves away from dating. I have been on first dates before where I was very nervous and a lot of that is because I didn't really know the other person. I was going to have to do everything in person which can be a bit hard. You don't want to say the wrong thing as that can tank the entire date. Technology allows us to text, call, send pictures, use dating apps, use FaceTime, Zoom, etc. There are so many dating benefits that come with it. I also think a hidden benefit of technology when it comes to dating is the ability of taking a picture or a video. This may not come across as a benefit to everyone but catching someone cheating via picture or video is evidence that can't be argued against. So while a relationship may end because of that and it will hurt one party badly, I still think it's a benefit. Who wants to date someone that isn't being faithful? I know people who have been in relationships in the past who suspect something is going on but don't want to believe it. When there is hard evidence, there is nothing the other person can do. So technology not only helps establish positive relationships, it also can end negative ones where one party is being taken advantage of.

{"text": "There are many benefits to listening to a book in my opinion since it allows you the ability to multitask while you are doing other things. For example, you can go for a jog while listening to a book, drive a car, or even clean the house. I am personally a huge fan of listening to books because i love efficiency. Any time i am able to get a lot of stuff done i just feel better about myself in general. I also dont really ever have a calm mind if i feel like i have a ton of stuff to do for the day anyway, so being able to get things done while also entertaining my brain is paramount. In addition to all of this, i find that audiobooks even save you money in comparison to the physical copy of the book. Digital versions of books are so much cheaper since there is no cost to actually make the book. While audiobooks have their benefits and happen to be my preference, i can understand the draw towards physical books as well. Being able to hold a book and read it right there is an immersive experience that some find hard to live without. It is completely quiet and all you hear are the sounds of the book in your mind. It is like meditating in a way, and this is what some people do to calm themselves. Reading is for the experience however, so whatever your preference is what you should go with. Whichever way allows you to most enjoy the book is the method that is best for you. Audiobooks simply allign with my lifestyle to a tee and is the obvious choice for me to get the most out of my day to day life while also enjoying a book. I dont think i would even shop for books if audiobooks were not available. I just have trouble finding the time in my day to day to read unless I want to take away some of the family time i get. think that audiobooks are a great way to get the most out of your day., and i am extremely grateful that they even exist.", "prompt_len": 1738, "label": "user_and_api"}

It is inconvenient to have to search out an adult to get a feminine product, and awkward when all you can find are male teachers. Most of the athletic coaches are my girls' schools are men, and both of my daughters have called me to bring them pads because they were too embarrassed to ask the coach for one. There should be no reason that this is happening. The only way these items are different is that the male students don't need them. Not sure if that is the reason they still aren't readily available or not. It does make me wonder if the boys needed these items, would they be in abundance? I absolutely think these items should be required by school. Giving the girls tokens of some sort if the school wanted to keep a machine in the girls bathrooms and locker rooms would be an idea. Each girl could get a certain number of tokens every month to access the machines and get what she needed. I have been to schools where there were pad and tampon machines in the girl's areas, but they cost a quarter to purchase. Honestly, what student is really carrying around change to buy these? This is a basic need that females have to deal with every month. It already sucks enough without having to go and beg for a pad or tampon when you are having a crisis and bleeding in your underwear.

For example, figuring out how to generate a tip to leave a server based on different percentages. We should learn about things that are important such as interest rates and mortgages. These are things that will help us as we become adults. There are things that we learn in history that also is extremely important. History allows us to not repeat mistakes that had happened previously. Without that evidence, we wouldn't know that it was a mistake in the first place. We also learn about previous cultures and can appreciate how our ancestors lived. The most important thing that I learned in school was math and then when I went to college it would be computer science. My major was Computer Science and I currently work as a Technical Support Manager at a web hosting company. I feel like there are aspects of college that are a waste of time as well. Ultimately, it comes down to money and greed. I knew I wanted to do something related to Computer Science when I was in High School. I was placed into the Computer Science program at my University from Day One. My first year in college I took a grand total of 0 computer science classes. This was because I had to waste time and money taking classes that don't pertain to computer science. Classes like English, Theology, and Art. These classes have nothing to do with my major, but I can't graduate without them. The more you think about school the more you realize that it's an imperfect solution. School should simply be there to teach children the important aspects of life. School should also help children learn to socialize, learn how to behave and learn how to follow rules.

Because if a helpless animal is deserving of pity, and help, a helpless human, who is ultimately just another suffering animal,  is deserving of this, as well.

You are able to be open about your feelings and open about your expectations because you know the other person is also looking for something similar. I personally have done dating with and without dating apps. I have had three girlfriends just going through high school and college, as it was much easier to meet people this way. When i graduated college, i was not interested in going to bars or parties, so i chose to use a dating app instead of simply waiting for the right person to find me. Although i met some people who i did not think i would be with for a long time, it really increased my perspective in what i wanted in a relationship. Later on, i met my fiance on a dating app whom I hit it off with right away. There is still a degree of luck to a dating app i would say, but probably less than simply being in the right place at the right time to meet people in person. Dating apps to me are just more of a way to get dates, to find your person. I still much rather talk on the app for only a couple of days and then meet in person for an official date. So to me personally, it is not super different. Now as far as other apps and their effect on relationships, this is either positive or negative depending on how the person themselves use the apps. Technology and apps are simply something that are going to be around, and with any positive comes a negative as you can use and abuse the positive. If the technology is taking away from your personal time with your significant other than it is time to dial it back. If you find yourself on social media when your partner wants you attention, this is a red flag. However, if you are using an app like netflix productively, and enjoying a show with your signficant other and cuddling, this can be a positive. It is all about balance. Anything that is good also needs to be used in balance. So in conclsuion, i personally feel that technology nowadays is a good thing for dating and relationships. I think it has made things easier for so many people.

A third group believed the current global situation was a house of cards that would eventually collapse, and that the US could be best served by remaining in isolation and sitting out the collapse. The U.S. moved to re-establish diplomatic ties with the world's nations, but internally, the debate over America's future quickly escalated, and before serious steps could be made in diplomacy, America found itself in a full-scale civil war, with the expansionist, isolationist, and diplomatic factions fighting for control of the United States.

{"text": "I am not a female, however i cant imagine what it would feel like to be trapped in school on your period that suddenly popped up, without any sort of tampon or pad. Especially a middle school girl who may not even know what is going on down there. At this age, i think schools should do their best to make sure that the girls are supported in this way. Schools can be rough, and it would stink to have a girl get made fun of for something like this she could not control. Im not saying that you need to put the pads or tampons in a vending machine or something like that, but i think every school nurse should have them to hand out in case a girl needs them. I would say that pads and tampons are similar to toilet paper, soap, and band aids because they are all essential type of products. What is a girl suppose to do if there were no such thing as tampons. She would probably have to just stick toilet paper or something in there. I dont think tampons and pads are overly expensive so there is really no reason why schools wouldnt be able to provide them and just buy them in bulk. If a school is even thinking about providing something like condoms, then they ought to have something like tampons. I just always think of the worst situation possible when it comes to these sorts of things, and i think of a girl who is thinking about just leaving school after something like this happens. I think of a girl who may bleed through her clothes and has nothing to change into. I know things like this must have happened before, so why not have a tampon that the girl can use to feel better and maybe even a change of pants. This would make a girl feel completely supported and really lessen the negative feeling associated with that day. It is a completely natural thing that happens, and they should not have to feel sorry for themselves about the situation. I would think most girls nowadays know about periods before they happen, but it would still be nice to be prepared. Thats a positive about social media i guess is that nothing is hidden. Young kids know about all of these things long before they become adults, so they are sort of desensitized to it. But i am sure there is still that one young girl who has been coddled and protected who would be completely thrown off when she sees blood down there.

Do college athletes realize that they are essentially being paid over $350,000 to play on their teams, because the value of the scholarships will pay tuition for four years, room fees, and food every day? It just shocks me that these students don't appreciate their scholarships, because many people would die just for a chance at getting a scholarship by the age of 18. I come from a family that doesn't have a lot of money, and I've seen the struggles they have gone through to make sure their children get an education.

I have a lot of respect for her when it comes to what she has to do in order to put us through school, and it hurts me that college athletes aren't grateful for the opportunities they've been given. No, they don't get paid for all of their hard work they put in daily, but their scholarship covers it. And if they want to give up their scholarships they'll have to pay for their own education just like the rest of us do. Would they rather have that or a scholarship?

I mean, I couldn't care less if some colleges have to go into a bidding war over a few studs, and I couldn't care less if a bunch of other colleges have to scramble financially to keep up.

{"text": "I think the news can affect someone's mental so strongly, that it is really up to that individual on whether they want to consume it or not. I would say that you do have some responsibility to know what is going on in the world, but you do not need to necessarily consume news to do it. For example, if you dont know about COVID or the pandemic than you are not being responsible as a citizen. However, if you dont know that the US just recently signed a new bill than it is probably ok. As long as you are not a hermit, if it affects you, you will probably find out at one point. I think that it is not possible to say that people are obligated to get their news from the media because it can literally make you depressed. The media can control the minds of people to a degree because they are showing you and effecting the way you think. If all you see is negative and violent news, you are going to think that you live in a violent and negative world. If you are on social media all the time and seeing other peoples lavish lives and highlight reels, you are most likely not going to be grateful for what you have. If you are listening to music that is talking about treating women in a certain way, or woman acting a certain way, you will probably find yourself doing these actions every now and then without even thinking about it. Everything we consume effects us, and we have to mentally know that this is a fact to combat at. As far as engaging with current events, i think that is more for entertainment than anything else, at least globally. Some people really enjoy knowing what is going on around the world, and if you plan on helping or plan on immersing yourself in the culture or news, than that is a great reason! For me myself, i dont get much at all from global news because of lack of interest. I also am not one to travel all that often. I feel like for me to care about the place i have to have been there. I feel bad saying that but it is just true. I feel for anyone going through hardships, but in my life now i am not really in a position to help until i get to where i need to be. Everyone is different, and if you enjoy engaging with current events then engage with current events! I think like this because i can get stressed out if i think about too many things going on around me. I just focus on being the best me and giving my best effort each day. It is not that i dont care about the world or other people, it is simply that i want to be happy and want to have a calm mind. My brain is very fast and i can get anxious if i try to worry about too many things at the same time. If i am going to induldge in any type of news i make sure that it is at night when i have completed my tasks for the day. In conclusion, I do not feel that people have a responsibility to keep up with the news. I just think that people need to know what is going on around them, at least enough to not be putting themselves or others into harms way.", "prompt_len": 2959, "label": "api"}

{"text": "The reason I believe this, is that existing sports already contain some inherently dangerous components, most of which result in serious injury on a fairly frequent basis, and some of which can even result in death. For example, football players experience bodily collisions with other players to the point of severe bodily damage on a regular basis. Broken bones and torn ligaments are almost routine, and concussions are common. A fair amount of football players --particularly in the high school and college ranks--suffer from post-concussion syndrome (which may not present itself for several months after the injury), and can effect them for the rest of their lives, and several players have suffered neck injuries that have resulted in permanent paralysis. Boxing, of course, is another sport that has a decidedly high risk of injury and death, as does MMA, while even sports that don't involve hard impacts with other players, like baseball and tennis, have their own unusual dangers, such as flying balls and obstacles that result in serious injury, and track competitors risk sprains or broken limbs from hurdles, high jumps and the long jump. Even golfers , whose sport is considered relatively safe in the grand scheme of things, can suffer minor injuries like chronic arthritis from repetitive motion, and serious injuries and even death by lightning strikes. My point is, that the risks of engaging in sports, are already high, and are inherent, and expected. Perhaps sports that mean certain death should be banned, but barring that, I can't see preventing competition in extreme sports, because if that were to occur, many just as dangerous (or even more so) existing sports would need to be banned as well,  which would lead to very few sports in which an athlete could lawfully compete.", "prompt_len": 0, "label": "user_and_api"}

{"text": "I think if someone is focused on suffering at all than they are pretty selfless in that aspect. I think it is more of a matter of perspective.", "prompt_len": 95, "label": "api"}
{"text": "The reason why people are more sensitive to animal rights is simply because we are less desensitized to seeing animals abused over humans. We see this happening to humans so often in movies, in real life, on the news, etc. I think humans have kind of built up a shell to when they see things like this. Animal suffering however is something that is more rare to us, and this causes a greater emotional response. So for the simple reason on why people tend to focus more on animal suffering, i think it has to do with the media. Throw the media out and i think the emotional response would be closer to even or even more on the human side. I personally also would say that animals produce more of a reaction in me when i see them suffering over humans. However, if i were to see a human suffering like that in person it may be different. The debate over whether someone would save their pet dog or a foreign tourist actually makes sense to me. Your pet is part of your family, so I would assume most people would save their pet over someone they did not know. If you have to make the choice, you would make the one that effects you the most. Saving your pet would save you from the sorrow you would face if your pet was gone. If the foreign tourist died, you would be upset for a day and then most likely be ok. You did not know the person personally, so all you are going to remember is the death itself. If you pet died, you would look back on all the memories, the love, and also the death. Not only this, but you are basically loosing a family member who you have come to care about. So tying this back to the main idea, i dont think it is wrong to focus on animal welfare even when humans are suffering. Everyone has that choice, and what they deem as more important goes strictly off of their perspective and their life in general. I could not say anyone is wrong for focusing on animal suffering. Sometimes, people may even feel like they can have more of an effect on animal suffering over human suffering. There are so many humans everywhere in different governments and demographics. Ending their suffering is really an unattainable goal in a way. So in conclusion, this is my stance on animal vs human suffering.", "prompt_len": 2222, "label": "api"}

It's too obvious and something dare I say, a little bit racist. So my tip for Hollywood producers and to any producers of any show really, is to not be afraid to have a diverse cast. White male leads have had their time in the spotlight, it's time to give someone else a chance.

I think that the teachers are very important, but more for what they can teach you in lifeskills. I think teachers are in a position to be fabulous role models for students. What students should learn in school I feel is what makes them happy, what makes them comfortable, how to achieve goals, etc. There are so many goals you can set in school because of all the resources around you. I learned a ton from playing sports all my life, and this was available to me through school. I gained my work ethic and most of my friends through playing football all my life through college. But in school i found out about the things that were challenging for me, and learned that i could overcome them. I learned that i had ADHD, and would have to find ways to cope in order to learn and do well in my classes. I learned how to organize my school work, but also my brain. I even learned how to cope with stressful situations and stressful environments. I learned when to stay away from certain people, and I learned how to make friends. I learned that taking risks brings rewards, and I learned that failing is ok and even a good thing. These are the important lessons i think students should learn in school. I think they should be ok with not always being the best in that structured of an environment. Realizing that they have their whole life to live, and they are unique in their own way. You just learn so much about yourself when you have to deal with uncomfortable situations, and school is the perfect place to make you uncomfortable in certain ways. Since everything is so structured, you are bound to come across situations that are unpleasant. Overcoming is where you learn about yourself. So in conclusion, the most important things that students should learn in school is about themselves. They should learn who they are as a person.", "prompt_len": 1949, "label": "api"}

Audiobooks also better engage the imagination. The sound of the words being read aloud, is immeasurably more evocative than their appearance on a page, and it's also the case that, when using sound rather than sight to engage our mental processes, we tend to engage them more fully, using both sides of our brain to process the resulting data, rather than just the one side that reading hard copy books activates. There's also the fact that audiobook narrators are often good enough that they can add an extra dimension to the story, or just their reading voice in itself is worth listening to, which can not only elevate a decent story, but also enhance the experience of reading something that's otherwise uninteresting by itself. Audiobooks are also accessible in areas where books may not be available.

It would be difficult to reveal these things to a stranger, or even to a blind date that a friend had tried to connect you with. While I think that online-dating has had the biggest impact, I can't ignore the impact that social media has had on the romantic scene. However, I have to admit, that the impact it has had is not much different than that of online-dating. One big advantage that social media has is that it helps us to discover people who are in our close network, but who we have simply not connected with yet. This could be colleagues at work, or friends of friends at school. There are many connections that might have slipped away in the offline world that can easily be made online. As for some other suggested topics such as texting and Netflix, I think that these are worthy of note, but not really game changers in their own right. Texting is certainly an easier way to communicate than speaking over the phone, so maybe it helps potential romantic relationships to blossom. It is another way to get an idea of someone's interests and values before you start dating them seriously. I was also specifically asked about Netflix, and I think that it is also noteworthy, but not game-changing. The infamous 'Netflix and Chill' date that people talk about is certainly a relic of a new tech-focused world, but is really not much more than a date that ends in 'coffee' at one's apartment. It was just a polite way to invite someone over for what you assume will be an intimate encounter. Netflix has merely provided an opening that some people may mutually exploit. In conclusion, I think that the future of dating will continue to be technology-focused, and I think that this is ultimately a good thing. It will benefit a lot of people, and the one's who think that it is excessive, are probably the ones who had no trouble finding dates in the offline world.", "prompt_len": 1972, "label": "api"}

And she would never listen when I told her to stop reading the news, because she claims that if she doesn't read about it then she's not fully informed. That meant she never went to bed earlier than 2-3am every night, because she always had to read the news once she got home. And she refused to go on a vacation that didn't have WiFi out of sight of the ocean, because she said she couldn't be away from 'life.' Honestly, that kind of thinking makes life very difficult and is a lot less enjoyable than just relaxing and enjoying yourself without stressing over what's going on in the world. It's just not possible to keep up with everything, so I think its better to just block it out. I personally feel that you can still be a good citizen without keeping up with the news. I don't need to spend time reading about what's going on in the Middle East, for example, because I'm not going to do anything about it. But I do know that it's important for me to show up at the animal shelter on Sunday morning to groom the dogs just in case the volunteers are sick, for example. So there are definitely ways to give back to my community and be a good citizen without having to know every single thing that's happening in the world. Frankly, I'm shocked that people even worry about what Madonna is doing. Why should I spend my time reading about her superstar gossip when I have a job and a family to worry about? I just don't see how it's possible that everyone in the world can keep up with all the news and still do things that benefit people around them.", "prompt_len": 0, "label": "user_and_api"}

These characters are just directors taking the easy way out. The characters have no depth. The stereotype they are portraying is their personality. That is very offensive to me. I understand why these roles are used in TV and film but it still bothers me if their entire character is just the stereotype. There are some stereotypes that work for me. Tony Soprano was the stereotypical mob boss. He was a stereotypical Italian male with an ego. But he also had depth to him. He showed vulnerability. He went to a therapist. He had anxiety. He had depression. The entire depth of his character wasn't that he was a stereotypical Italian. You kind of forgot about that while you were watching the show.

I definitely wouldn't watch a specific television show or a movie if a character was being portrayed in a highly offensive and stereotypical way. I understand that some people use stereotypes to teach a viewing audience about past culture. I also find stereotypes to be used less and less due to the societal backlash that comes with it. An audience isn't going to accept offensive stereotypes in movies and TV just because they're playing a character. The character has to have depth to them. Stereotypes are wrong.

{"text": "But, that being said, the money that these colleges, tournament agencies, and other outlets that are profiting because of these athletes should be monitored and should be taken a look into.

Not to mention that their team uniforms, their airline tickets, their food, their housing, and their medical care is all paid for by the college. They are also almost certain that by the time they graduate, they will have a job waiting for them. So I think paying these athletes is not necessary. However, after saying all that, I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off of these athletes. There should be a third party watchdog that monitors the money that is being made off of these athletes. I am in favor of salary caps and salary floors, which would make it so that the money that is being made off of these athletes is more evenly distributed. Any excess for profits with colleges and universities, as well as the NCAA, should be donated to a charity that helps not only the athletes, but also the communities that they come from. The athletes can also pinpoint or select a charity that they would like to donate the money to. Because even though these athletes do not need compensation because of their lifestyle that they are living, they should still be able to have a say in where their money goes. Too much loss of life and suffering we are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and any excess money from the NCAA can help those who are in need. So, just to reiterate, you have gotten to know my point: I do not think that college athletes should be paid, but I do think that the NCAA should be more transparent about how much money they are making off and any excess on a specified salary cap should be given to a charity that helps those in need.

{"text": "I think these are the two most important things that students should learn while in school. This is because time management and communication are invaluable skills to have in any setting, regardless of whether the student goes on to work in a professional industry or not. Even a person who doesn't have a 'traditional' job, such as a stay at home mom, can benefit from being able to manage her time efficiently and communicate well with others. I currently have a job working as a restaurant hostess. Certainly I don't have the 'best' job, and I'm sure many people don't consider it a 'real' job, but I'm sure you would be surprised at how much my efficiency, or lack thereof, can help or hurt my restaurant. If I'm not managing my time well, it can mess up other servers' tables. And I'm sure you would also be surprised at how my communication skills can make or break my job. For example, if a customer asks me a question, and I don't answer them quickly, it can make the customer angry. As another example, if I answer the phone in a cheerful manner, it makes the customer happy. So really, even though I don't have a traditional job in an office setting, it's still really useful to know how to effectively communicate and manage my time. These should really be the pillars of what students should learn in school. Yes, it's of course important to learn math or science or history, but I truly believe that knowing how to effectively communicate and manage your time is almost infinitely more useful than anything else you might be learning from your teachers. After all, I hardly ever have to use geometry or algebra in my day-to-day life, but if I'm the hostess at a restaurant and a table of customers is upset about something, it's up to me to manage my other tasks so I can get to their table quickly, apologize and make them happy. I can definitely count on one hand the number of times I've had to make change with scientific notation in my current job, but I know how to communicate clearly with customers. And I think that's why my boss has me as the hostess, not another person with many more years of experience. My boss has always said that it's important to have a person who can interact with people well as the front person of the restaurant. And that's why he chose to have me do this for him, because even though it's only been a year, I've already shown that I am capable of effectively interacting with his most valued patrons. In conclusion, effective communication and time management have really allowed me to excel in my current situation, and I believe they would also be extremely valuable to success in any career. If I ever change careers in the future, I am certain that I will be well equipped for success because of what I currently know. For these reasons, I am confident that the most important things students should learn in school are how to effectively manage their time and communicate clearly. After all, do students really need to know about polar explorers when they could be learning how to effectively handle their lives in the real world?

In this way, it's possible to get to know someone , and maybe even fall in love, without ever meeting them face to face.

{"text": "I think that since screens are simply a part of our lives now, it really only depends on how it is used. I would say that the majority of people without a doubt abuse it, however there are some that use it an extremely productive ways. I think that during the pandemic specifically, social media and screens is really the only thing that made us feel connected. Without social media, i think the pandemic would have felt a lot more lonely. We would have felt like we were living in the early 20th century or something like that. I think this would have made people go crazy. People would have been fighting over resources and fending for their lives like it was an apocolypse simply because it is so different to how we live today. So overall to me social media is what helped the pandemic a lot, but of course with any positive comes a negative. Social media also caused a lot of depression and mental issues. People would see others and be upset that they could not spend time with them, or see people doing fun things and feel like their life is super monotonous. Social media is truly a double edged sword.", "prompt_len": 1066, "label": "user_and_api"}

If used in moderation, i think you would give your chance more of an opportunity to experience these things and realize that your life is pretty great as well. So in conclusion, i think screens have won in a way, and we should embrace them. We just need to be sure that we are aware that too much of anything can be bad, and if we overuse these sort of tools than we are only setting ourselves up for failure. I wouldnt even be opposed to schools having classes on different ways to use modern day technology since there are so many positive ways to do so. People can create their own brands on social media. People can learn valuable skills and meet new people using technology. Dating is so much easier with these different apps you can use nowadays and it has led to many happier lives all around.

People who like these sort of extreme sports often have a need for that sort of adrenaline that they get when they participate in the sport. If they were not to be able to use the sport to get their adrenaline, i am sure they would just find another place to do it. Often times there are not many normal life events or activities that can fulfill this same purpose, and this is why people turn to these sports for that gap. While it can of course be very risky to do these types of activities, it is that person's choice at the end of the day. People are going to have the freedom to make their own choices regardless, and unless the mountain itself is closed down for climbing, i would assume people would engage in the activity. I think this can also give people a lot of fullfillment through the sport, and this in turn makes them a better person. People need a little risk in their lives sometimes to feel alive. If they have to climb a mountain to get their kick, or ride on a bike or skateboard really fast, why not let them do it? I am just not a big proponent on restricting anyones choice in this way, as long as they are not forcing other people to do the same activity or putting anyone into danger. Something like climbing, is an individual activity. If that person was to make the choice to go and do it, why not let them try?

I don't think any sport is too dangerous to be called a sport. Boxing and MMA are two of the most popular sports in the world and they feature blood and knockouts all the time. Those fighters know what they are signing up for and most of them love the competition. Extreme is a word that doesn't have a concrete definition. What's extreme for a certain portion of people is normal for others. Hence why there is no line that needs to be drawn. The only time I think a line should be drawn is as a parent. If you as a parent don't feel comfortable with your child playing football for example due to fears of concussions and broken bones, that is entirely your right. Your priority as a parent is to keep your child safe. You get to draw that line. When it comes to extreme sports, there's no such thing as something that is too extreme for the general population.

{"text": "Nobody expects the school to provide them to students at home, of course, but while they are at school, their hygiene needs must be met. The only difference between them, if any, is that tampons are designed to be private. They also provoke a certain degree of anxiety and shame in young women, and that needs to be addressed. Perhaps sex education classes should be segregated, and changed to include menstruation education, if they don't include it already, in order to minimize the shame that periods generate. If the schools are going to provide tampons or pads to female students during school hours, this sex ed course would be the perfect time to do it. So yes, the school should probably provide free tampons and pads, because they are vital to the health and comfort of female students, even if this would require making some accommodations for them to do so. It's also essential that the school administration makes it clear to all of the girls that they do not deserve to feel shame for something that is completely natural, and that the school administrators have no intention of shaming someone for something as fundamental as periods. Other than the sex ed classes, tampons or pads could be provided at the nurse's office, or other medical offices, and girls who aren't menstruating to this time can simply be informed of where they can obtain one if they need one during their period, without being lectured on whether or not they need their own pads or tampons, or whether they deserve to have them. Being male, I of course have never experienced 'period poverty' or period shaming, but I did go to school, and I know students can be very cruel. The school owes it to young women to acknowledge and respect their physical needs as best they can, without creating an atmosphere of shame. If needed, students who engage in hurtful behavior towards young women related to periods, can be disciplined in accordance with school policies. With all of these policies in effect, hopefully school will be a more comfortable and supportive place for young women who are menstruating, and it will become clear to everyone that periods do not define women in any kind of a negative way. After all, young women are just as human as any of the boys and men in the school, and deserve to be treated as such, and if they are, I am confident that periods will soon be one of those things that nobody in public school even thinks about anymore.", "prompt_len": 0, "label": "user_and_api"}

This makes people refer to the athletes almost like they are being taken advantage of. I understand the perspective of the athlete being taken advantage of, however they are still given the platform to demonstrate their skills, and also given the opportunity to play in front of large crowds and meet tons of people, and build a following on social media. Many perks come with being a college athlete aside from just possibly being paid. The free tuition is nice for the athlete, however i dont know how much paying the athletes would be helpful. Would they be paid based off of talent, or just a flat fee? If it was a flat fee, the athletes would probably want more anyway if they were the star players. I am personally a former college football player as well, and I just feel that it is not necessary to pay the players. I think it would be nice to have more in place for the athletes, but not necessarily just a pay check. I know there are some athletes who can barely afford college and food while being there. This is unexceptable to me if they are part of a team making that much money for the university.

Koolaid is what was served to those there. They also didn't bother to find out about current events. Allowing their autonomy to be given up, families who whispered warnings were ignored. Almost everyone who followed Jones ended up as victims being poisoned or shot, or damaged forever.

She normally keeps them in her purse of course, however it can be difficult if she ends up running out. This perspective leads me to believe that it can be super stressful for a young woman who was new to getting her period. Making these resources available in school would really lessen the stress and make the girls feel more supported and calm. It can be super embarassing i would assume for a girl to have to go through this, and also scary in a way. This is why i feel that middle schools especially, but even high schools should have these resources around. I am not sure if they are really necessary in elementary schools, but middle schools should make it a priority. Or maybe just giving them to the school nurse so girls know they can go there if they need one. Girls can be mean, and all it takes is for one incident to really dampen a girls reputation. The priority is for schools to allow for girls to be able to be completely present while in school, and to not have to worry about those types of things. By providing this type of support, i think you are ultimately giving the girls access to a more effective education. I personally put tampons and pads into the same category as toilet paper, soap, and band-aids. Well maybe not soap, but definitely the other two. These are all things i find in our bathroom trashcan when i empty it, so i correlate all of them. They all also serve similar purposes in a way. Band aids are used for blood, and toilet paper is used for cleaning. The two together are sort of what a tampon or pad serves for.

{"text": "For example, a movie when the popular girl is really mean to everyone and is always putting down the main character. This makes me cringe simply because of how direct it is as a steretype. The stereotype of people who are popular being main is just so overused i feel. It would be cool to see movies have these types of kids be nice more often instead of mean. In addition to this, the stereotype also brings along other characters that are cringey like the sidekick of the popular kids. The sidekicks are always just hype men who repeat what the popular kid said. Also, the sidekick will do anything they can to please the popular kid, and they really sound more like a puppet over anything else. Maybe it is suppose to be like this though. Since often times the popular kid in school ends up being an antogonist, and getting to see the antogonist loose at the end of the movie is something that a lot of people like seeing in a movie. There are not many movies that I would not watch just going off of the stereotypes, as to me it can be a good thing to cringe at certain types of people. The way the stereotype is used is most important to me, because it can still be entertaining with a character like this. I just like to see creativity in movies, books, and shows, so sometimes the stereotype can make a movie much worse if it is not used in the right way. For books, i am much more lenient with the stereotypes simply because you get a much more in depth perspective of the characters in these types of media. You really get to understand what causes the character to act like that more often than you do in movies. I can really feel like i become a character when i read books just because of how often i feel i am in their thoughts. I learn a lot about myself and also learn alot about different situations people can go through. A great movie can do this as well, and sometimes hits me even stronger if done in the right way simply because of the visual appeal added on. So in conclusion, i feel stereotypes can be what makes or breaks a movie in a way.

{"text": "Honestly, for my undergraduate education, my parents , as hardworking as they may have been, couldn't have afforded to send me to a top-notch private school. But athletes are not only given a free education, but also a platform to add extra benefits. And that education is priceless, although if you really had to put a dollar value on the tuition, it would be over $350,000 over 4 years. And that is a shocking amount of money, when you take into account that it is an advanced education that you would otherwise have to pay for on your own. I know of no job that I would be qualified for that makes that kind of money, and college athletes are making that kind of money at the age of 18. I mean, how many 18 year olds do you know who are making the equivalent of a grown-up salary? In fact, $350,000 over the course of 4 years is more than a starting salary for a graduate with a degree in a relatively lucrative field like engineering. So how could I possibly argue that a college athlete should be paid? I mean, considering that my parents did not have enough money to send me to public school, it is more than clear that the athletes who get the full ride should just be grateful for all they get. I have no idea how some people could demand more, considering what some people go through to even get accepted as a college athlete.

I just don't see how you could argue that college athletes should be paid, not when a shocking amount of them struggle to do well in school. They should be in school as students, not as professional athletes. Yes, their athletic activities might generate revenue on the school, but it is their education that will secure their future. So it's frustrating to me that some of these college athletes would even try to get paid, when they're already making more than most people, and when they're given the opportunity to get their college education for free. Plus, a lot of schools give their athletes a stipend, but a lot of these college athletes spend it on designer clothes and other forms of wastefulness. I even heard that Soeurette spent a large chunk of her academic stipend on a designer purse from Kate Spade. That's just the kind of ghetto spending that I am appalled at, because she could have just gone to TJ Maxx and purchased an equivalent purse for about 15 times less money.

If being able to receive tampons and pads is going to help female students, it should happen without any questions asked.

Students that are boys don't have to worry about any of the embarrassment that could come from female students not having pads or tampons. At the very least, the female students voices should be heard. They're really the only ones that matter in this situation. If they say that they'll be more comfortable with free pads and tampons, they should be provided. Someone would have to explain to me the negative aspect of these items being provided other than increased costs. I also can't imagine that the costs would be enough to make any significant dent in the amount that schools receive from the government via taxes. The only difference between items like pads and tampons compared to items like toilet paper and soap is that there is a more embarrassing stigma surrounding the former.

I think most families would support this as well because again, the students are children. They should be as comfortable as possible in school and I guarantee parents would want that as well.

{"text": "It's also a possibility. That's why it's always a two-fold and multi-faceted discussion when it comes to something that can become exponentially more influential, powerful and persuasive with time. What I suggest is that parents, companies, and the government should step in and try to change the nature of our screen habits, before this new digital world starts overtaking the more traditional ways of life of our evolution. The company, Facebook, has started removing the notifications feature on their home screen because of all the incessant distracting 'Likes' and '+1's'. Google has also implemented the 'Do Not Disturb' feature to help you turn off your phone at night, if that's what you want to do. However, these steps are just the initial steps and the companies need to do more to ensure that we aren't getting lost in our digital world. China's banning of people under the age of 18 from playing games is an extreme and drastic step to take, and I wouldn't want to see this type of action taken in the United States. Instead, a federal law to urge app makers and companies to monitor the screen habits of our youth might be more effective in preventing things like compulsive gambling, compulsive shopping, compulsive texting, and any type of addiction that leads to more unnecessary screen time. Educators and parents should also step up to ensure our kids are not losing valuable time in their development, health, and social life because they are lost within the confines of their screens. A more hands-on approach and a more sensitive level of mentorship for our youth can reduce the let-down from our digital world by introducing more hands-on experiences and personality.", "prompt_len": 24, "label": "user_and_api"}

Instead, we should talk about the nuanced, more specific and technical aspects about how to balance the modern lifestyle with the ways of our ancestors. This can be done by analyzing and studying different aspects of life like our social interaction, our health, and our cognitive ability, where all of these three aspects are intertwined.

Some audiobooks the speed is too high or too low no matter how much you change the speed settings. When I read a physical book, I can read at my own pace. I also enjoy looking at the pictures in a book that are specifically found in biographies. Since an audiobook is just audio, you can't see the pictures. I prefer to use audiobooks just because of the convenience of them. I love having the ability to lay in my bed before I go to sleep and listen to a chapter. It helps relax me. I also want to make it clear that I love reading physical books as well. Both methods give a unique experience to the reader and I don't think either method is going to go away anytime soon.

Naturally, their is a sense of privacy and urgency related to tampons and pads, given that unlike Band-Aids or similar items, many female students do not want others to know that they requested such items from the school. Therefore, schools should take heed and use caution when giving such items, doing so in a private and respectful way, that does not disclose the identity of the female students requesting such items, and maintains their anonymity. Failure to do so can lead to bullying, that shames such students for having a natural bodily process, and for essentially struggling to not afford such items.

{"text": "in general My experience with dating apps has been great. Thanks to Tinder and OkCupid, I have been able to meet and date some really cool people. In fact, I am currently dating someone I met on Tinder. I met her at a bar, but we connected on Tinder first. The first date went well and we have been seeing each other ever since. I think that we would have never met if it weren't for Tinder. I believe this relationship will last because we have a lot in common and we are both very similar. When it comes to Netflix, I think the effect on dating and relationships is neutral, and trivial. Before Netflix, people would go out to the movies on dates, or rent a movie, or watch TV. Netflix is just another way to do that, the 21st century way. Social Media has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, and has also made it easier to meet new people to date. I think its effects have also been generally positive. The only downsides are that it can be a distraction, and it can be used to spread negativity. Checking up on a partner's social media accounts can be a good way to see if they are being honest, but it can also turn into a way to spy on them. Again, though, before social media existed, paranoid people would still check up on their partners, and it caused the same problems in relationships then, that it does now. Social media is just a new way to do it. Texting is a great way to stay in touch with people, and it is also a great way to flirt. Emojis are a great way to easily express flirtatious or emotional sentiments, and texting enables plenty of that. Texting is also quick, and convenient, and not only does it enable new relationships to blossom, it helps to maintain existing relationships and keep them strong and healthy. In short, technology has been a great boon to dating and relationships. It has created many new ways to start new relationships, and it has also made it easier to maintain existing relationships. It has some downsides, but those downsides are not new, and they are not unique to technology. So, the new things it has introduced, have been more than worth it.", "prompt_len": 0, "label": "user_and_api"}

All the more advanced types of maths and sciences arent all that beneficial to many of the lives of students, especially those who plan on working after graduation. The classes i feel should be implemented more often stem around life skills, and mental health. I believe there should be an entire class on finances in my opinion. An entire marking period or semester spent on credit, one spent on investing and saving, one spent on debt and saving, etc. Just more life skills over the general education types of courses. Not only this but i think nutrition should be taught in a much more in depth way. I think itd be a great idea to teach about foods as a way to heal your body, like medicine. This can tie into mental health. Instead of looking for drugs to feel better and less anxious, how about trying some magnesium. Maybe eating a higher fat diet will slow your mind down anxiety wise, eating more pastured eggs, or nutritious foods like raw milk, organ meats, fatty fish, etc. The most important thing i learned in school personally had nothing to do with any of my classes.

Basically, the schools with the most money would end up ruling the league. I think a better alternative would be a stipend or something like that so college players would be able to live comfortably and not have to worry about any sort of expenses during the school year. There is no need for the athletes to be paid like professionals, however they should be granted some sort of money just because of the impact they are making for the school financially. There are stories of college athletes who cant even afford food during the stay in college. This is unacceptable due to all they do for the university. Another possible issue that may come with paying NCAA athletes would be the fact that some schools have a lot more money than other schools. This would make it difficult for the NCAA to issue any league wide policy for athletes. I think it would turn into some sort of percentage, and this would still cause a big difference in the amount of money athletes make from school to school. So in a way, the bidding process would still be a thing. Maybe having a cap would be a good way to work around this idea if equality was what they were shooting for in the NCAA. Either way, there seems to be drawbacks for each type of method chosen. In conclusion, i still feel that NCAA athletes should be paid some sort of money. The specific way it is done is up in the air, but i think most people agree that it is very inhumane to not offer the athletes anything when the organization profits so much.", "prompt_len": 1665, "label": "api"}

As magical beings, humanity had always had a firm grasp on on our magical powers. As our world grew, our magical powers began to wither away.

Our government had tried for years to limit the birth of children in order to maintain our magical powers to a certain degree, but progress was too slow. Most of our magical powers were mere shadows of what they used to be. The supply of mana could not power our magical ambitions. As morbid as it sounds, some humans saw the alien invasion as an opportunity to start over, a clean slate. The alien invaders enslaved humanity and killed countless others on their conquest of our planet.

Human knowledge progresses, and as it does, so does our understanding of the world and the people in it. So while a lot of the stereotypes that are considered most offensive now were created in works that were created a long time ago, they were created in an era when people didn't know as much about the world as we do now, and I'm more inclined to try to view those works from long ago in the context of the time in which they were created, rather than judge them by the standards of today. That being the case, I'm much less forgiving of the stereotypes that are present in modern works, because I expect more from modern writers. For example, such stereotypes as the 'dumb blonde' or the 'loud black woman' are offensive not only to people belonging to modern groups, but the writer should know they aren't accurate portrayals, and should know better than to use them.

{"text": "My presidency of 8 years was one of the most stressful, but rewarding experiences of my life. To be able to lead a nation of people toward a brighter, bigger future, contains some of my proudest memories of my life. I was now retired after my presidential tenure, looking to occupy my time with family and hobbies. My wife Michelle, and my kids, Sasha and Malia, were always supportive of my endeavors. I decided to pick up gardening as my hobby during my retirement. It was relaxing and stress free, exactly what the doctor ordered. The summer days were difficult to garden in because of the warm weather, which is why I enjoyed gardening in the early mornings, before the blazing sun had a chance to greet me. After a long day of work, I decided to take a well deserved nap in my bedroom, away from the summer heat. two hours later, I awoke with a grand thirst and reached for my cold, water bottle on the bedside table. I felt around the table with my eyes half closed, but touched something unfamiliar. I rolled over to see a mysterious letter sitting on the table. That letter was not there when I went to bed, it had no return address; nevertheless, it was clearly postmarked to me. I called for Michelle, but there was no answer. I forgot that she was planning on taking the girls to the beach for the rest of the day, so I had the house all to myself. I reached for my letter opener and to my surprise, it was signed by 'JFK'. I could not believe my eyes, JFK was no longer living. He had been assassinated decades ago under mysterious circumstances.

But tht is post-school life anyway - graduates with degrees from 'better'  schools have an easier time finding better, higher paying jobs, and student athletes from schools with strong programs are more likely to go on to be professional athletes. In fact, allowing college athletes to be paid, with oversight and a number of regulations, might help cut down on the unofficial and rather shady system of perks that is now used, making the whole system much more transparent and accountable. More attention would be paid to what students are actually receiving, and with caps might actually be fairer to all students.

{"text": "A student athlete getting paid would not the economy of universities. The amount that these schools make off of the student athletes is incredible. We're talking about millions and in some case billions of dollars and the student athletes don't see a cent of that. I do understand the point that student athletes would become a bidding war for universities that have a lot of capital. I don't see that as any difference than free agency in sports. Typically the highest bidder will win but there are some cases where an athlete wants to be close to home or takes a hometown discount. At the very least, the student athlete should have to weigh those options. The easy way to solve that issue as well is simply to limit the amount that a student athlete can make. $250,000 is a fantastic salary for a student athlete and is life changing money for any 18 to 22 year old. You can put a specific criteria on the salary such as maintaining a 2.0 GPA each semester or their salary is forfeited or at the very least a portion is. This allows there to be fair competition between the universities and a school like Alabama won't be able to simply outbid a school like Syracuse. Student athletes are working as a full time athlete and a full time student. Shouldn't they be paid for their efforts? What happens if a student athlete gets both a academic and an athletic scholarship? That student is punished if they get a full ride for both categories. They are entitled to 2X the scholarship amount and instead just get one scholarship amount. The business of college athletics has been a scam for way too long. Student athletes have been exploited by universities for far too long. You have coaches like Clemson's Dabo Swinney saying that student athletes shouldn't be paid and that he'd retire if they did. Well, a bill was passed that allows student athletes to get paid for their imagine and likeness. Did Swinney retire? Of course not. He makes upwards of 10 million dollars a year. Imagine that. A coach making 10 million dollars a year while his players make absolutely nothing. Again, a scenario where most logical and reasonable people will look at and say 'that is unfair.' The only people who will say that it's fair are the people that are making tons of money off of those student athletes. Luckily, more and more people who have power have seen this issue and have acted in the student's favor.

So, onto the business at hand, the most common and harmful stereotype I see is that of black people. This goes back to the Jim Crow era in which African-Americans were portrayed as happy fools who loved to work on plantations, where they could dance and sing in the sunlight. Needless to say, this was never true, but it made white audiences feel better about themselves. In this one case, I think that the stereotype was indeed created from willful malice. Hattie McDaniels's character in Gone with the Wind is another example. She is portrayed as someone who would be helpless if she was not enslaved by a rich white family, and we are meant to believe that she is grateful for what she received. However, this is also an instance in which a black woman was humanized and portrayed fairly respectfully on screen, so I cannot totally object to it.

This is just as bad as explicitly claiming that all black people are involved in crime, because that is what the audience is led to believe. This might actually be beneficial for society, because audiences who came to see a heroic white cast, might end up learning a subtle lesson about questioning the stereotypes that pervade our society. Unfortunately, I cannot readily think of an example in which I have seen this happen in fiction, and there have been far to many examples of harmful stereotypes.

This not only harms the group as a whole, but it also affects individual actors.

Someone might assume that a young Asian person is smart, especially at math, or that someone who wears glasses is a good student. They might assume that Native Americans are noble in spirit, or that elderly African Americans are devoted to family values. These are all stereotypes that appear from time to time in fictional characters, and I have to object to them as well.

In addition, we cannot pretend that the news media is impartial and unbiased. All persons are biased toward a certain viewpoint, and this bias can become entrenched when journalists have to please college professors and later editors who all tend to feel the same way.

That isn't to say some will view it as feasbile or impractical to pursue, but most will understand the dangers and steer clear based on their own vocation. Those sports will continue to remain sports even if many view them as too dangerous or risky, as it will still have participants willing to work towards meeting their demands and overcoming its risks, to make amazing feats and achievements based on physical and mental prowess.", "prompt_len": 929, "label": "api"}

I think that the only realistic way to even talk about payment to athletes would be if the NCAA just made the payments to all the student-athletes by division, and gave them all a set amount of money. Either this, or they give out other non-monetary types of perks. What should not happen however, is these same student-athletes struggling to pay for their dorms, or barely having enough food to eat. I have heard so many stories of these well known players who could barely pay to survive in school. That makes absolutely no sense since they are helping provide tons of funds to the school they are at. I think the least they could do is make sure the student athletes all have plenty of food and no worry whatsoever on the cost of their rooms. This should be the minimum in my opinion. From there, yea we can talk about some sort of monetary payment. So i played college football at a division II school, and although we were division II, we were a top 10 team each year and actually made the championship and lost my senior year. I dont think the amount of money we generate is anywhere near the amount at a big college football school in division one, so of course the monetation would have to vary based off of this. Either way, i think it is acceptable for these student athletes to be paid. I just think it will be a tough process because this would mean that all student-athletes would want to be paid, or essentially any team or group on campus that contributes to the college making money. While it is a huge opportunity to begin with to play college sports, i do think the ncaa could do a much better job at providing for these students. As the prompt says, it is important to avoid the bidding war, and the only way you can do this is by paying a flat fee i would suppose to all the athletes in that division. This would however cause the schools who are making more money to contribute much more than the schools making a lower amount of money. But who knows maybe this would actually even out the competition for the schools, and end up in a much more fair recruitment process that goes more off of the school itself as opposed to just the team. So in conclusion, i think student athletes to have the right to be paid, however the ncaa is going to have to make sure they are very careful in the way they choose to go about doing this.", "prompt_len": 2553, "label": "api"}

{"text": "Since the dawn of time, people have managed to establish intimate relationships by meeting each other in real life, gradually learning to trust one another, and eventually being at the point to where they really want to begin a relationship with each other. 21st century technological developments have only added a layer of bizarre complexity to this process, and have further isolated people to the point where this process fails before it can even begin. Dating apps are the greatest example of this. I've used them, and the experience is not unlike playing online poker, or playing video games -- the main point of it is to kill time in lieu of having better things to do. The way the time killing process works with them, is that, you open up the app, conveniently right around the time you would otherwise go to bed, and start swiping through dozens of unappealing or phony users until you find one or two that you like, and begin exchanging messages with them, which might then end in a flaky or disconnected face-to-face interaction, which might then end in a crappy date that doesn't lead to anything further, which then leads you back to the beginning with yet more profiles of people you don't have anything in common with, and who you don't really want to meet.

Simply put, the Coalition has the numbers. You ask yourself how it's possible that all these countries could come together as one and start to feel panic. The only thing that makes logical sense is these countries banded together to take down the US. Why else would they break the post WWII rules and not go into isolation? You have another meeting with the coalition and try to create an agreement with them. There will be no conflicts and the United States will stick to their own country. They don't want to get involved in any of the matters that the Coalition are involved in. The agreement is signed. The United States and the Coalition will not get involved in any internal conflicts and will stay neutral related to each other. The issue for the Coalition is they didn't realize how difficult it is to run an entire nation filled with different people and countries within it. Greed ended up getting the best of them and their nation ended up collapsing. There were civil wars, economic collapses, and no real way of being on the same page. The Coalition then spread apart and became nothing. Each country went their separate way and had to rebuild.

Renting a bummer of a movie often led to arguments about whose fault it was for renting that title, and not finding stuff you both wanted led to arguing about how you should have gone to the theater instead. With Netflix, you can still end up with bad movies, but the consequence is less severe, and most of the time, you can find something you both want... even if it's different stuff. Texting, compared to prior methods of communicating, is superior in its speed and lack of pronouns. It's quicker than a call, and it avoids the problem of people being on different schedules and talking at different times. It is somewhat limited in what it can communicate, but in many cases, that's a plus, because it reduces arguments about what's being said and read into.

You also have to remember that some television shows and movies have to include stereotypes to fit the time period they're depicted in.

These stereotypes can also be used as a learning tool. Movies about slavery teach children why it was so horrific and why being racist is bad. Stereotypes are tricky for me when it comes to films and television. Things that would offend me in real life don't offend me in movies and television.

{"text": "The first benefit that I think of is that we can listen to a book when it's dark. We can't read a book in the dark and if we try, we actually are doing damage to our eye sight. You also can change speeds on an audiobook. I typically listen to mine on 1.5X or 2X which allows me to read a book quicker. There also are books that are written in languages different than English but are translated to English via Audiobook. I can't read anything other than English but if I wanted, I could listen to the translated audiobook version. Audiobook's also allow you to listen while you are driving. You can listen to a book each day on the way to your job for example. This is all time that you're physically incapable of reading a book because you have to focus on the road. I do think that there are benefits to having a physical book as well. The main benefit is simply just having the book in your hands. Something just feels right when I am holding a book and reading it. Maybe it's something my brain is just comfortable with. I find the audiobook version helps me retain information better as well. I struggle a bit when reading to fully take in what I'm reading. I read very fast and a lot of times I'll finish a chapter without really understanding what I just read. I for whatever reason learn better when I hear the information out loud. I typically listen to audiobooks late at night. I don't have any distractions at that point so I can concentrate best. I personally prefer my books to be audiobooks. I find the benefits really help me understand the book better than if I were to read it the traditional way.

So, regardless of what happens with this pandemic, the trend towards increased screen time is likely to continue, and since we've been forced there already, we might as well embrace the change and its benefits. For example, as an information worker, I can now 'go into' work from home two or three days a week, if I have to. At the moment, the reason for doing that is disease prevention, but since it began, I've found that I can do just as much, or more work from home than in the office.

Another example is   keeping in touch with my entire extended family and friends by text message, email, Snapchat and Instagram. Even before the pandemic, this was starting to replace the time I used to spend talking on the phone with them, so now, it's become the main way of staying in touch, but I'm convinced it was going to do that anyway.

Traditional media was already dying and Millennials and Gen Zs (the generation of kids who go to school now) had started to live their entertainment online before the pandemic,  plus screen based entertainment has become so high quality that it's hard not to want to watch that instead of traditional media. Computers and the internet have revolutionized access to information and allowed many to be able to create stuff and entertain themselves, in a way that's far more convenient, and often cheaper, than going to the bookstore, or the empty cinema, or the overpriced amusement parks of the past.

{"text": "I think anyone can do anything they set their mind to as long as they look at it the right way. If you do something everyday to contribute to your goal there is no way you can fail.

Whether you have athletic goals, or academic goals, a goal to get a boyfriend/girlfriend, a goal to be the leader of a club, etc. As long as you are doing something productive towards your goal, there is no way you fail. If you can shift your mind to take the positive out of any negative situation, it is a sure fire way to be happy in your life and learn from your mistakes. I think teenagers and kids in general need to take their mind and mental health so much more seriously, and learn how to control their thoughts and brain before their lives get to stressful. When you become an adult, there are so many more things you need to think about. If you dont know how to talk about your emotions and deal with them by the time you get older, it can be very difficult to do things like go after your goals or be helpful to other people. You need to help yourself before you can help others, and being aware of this as early as high school is a great way to continue to grow as a human. For me personally, knowing that i can achieve whatever goal i work at has impacted my life greatly. I am addicted to pursuing goals, and if i dont have one i feel empty. I played sports all my life, so that was something that always gave me a goal to work on. However, when i finished playing football in college, i realized that i needed to start and find goals outside of athletics. This led me to creating my own business and even getting into boxing, which yes is not outside of athletics, but is a huge challenge and mental challenge as well.

{"text": "Animals are not really capable of fending for themselves or living on their own the majority of the time. So when an animal is suffering or beaten, it sort of is similar to a little baby being beaten. As far as people being more upset than they are to people, i think we are just desensitized when it comes to human suffering. We see it so often in the news, media, movies, etc. We kind of just feel it is normal, and we know that people are going to do mean things sometimes. I think in a way, if were to be so upset about it each and every time we would drive ourselves crazy mentally. Needless to say, people still do get upset at humans suffering as well, i think the actual news of it though is just a little densensitized. You dont hear about dogs suffering in the newspaper or on the news, but you do with people. I think we as people realize that animals are left out of media sometimes, so when we do hear about their suffering it is almost like it is in a spotlight. Also, people find animals to be much more innocent and adorable in comparison to humans. When you see a cute dog all you want to do is love it and protect it. I think part of this instinct comes from the fact that they cannot really fend for themselves often times, and need someone to help them. Its the same feeling you would get if you saw a infant that was left outside by itself, or if you saw someone harming a little baby. The baby can not protect itself, so your instinct is to go and help it. I personally dont feel it is wrong to focus on animal suffering, as i feel that if you are focused on helping anyone that is suffering it is a good deed. As far as where to dictate our funds as a country, i think it would be smarter to help people out. Helping people out would be an investment anyway, and this would allow those people who were helped to help out the animals. The more healthy people we have, the more homes we have for these animals. As far as testing products out on animals and what not, i think this is going to happen regardless. Unless we allow experiments on people, animals are simply going to have to take the burden here. The meat industry will probably never go away either. Humans were brought up eating meat, and there would be many deficiencies if we just stopped eating meat all together in my personal opinion. I get some people may be different, however i think that for the large majority of people meat consumption is important. The best thing we can do i would say would be to treat these animals right and give them great lives while they are here.

{"text": "Nowadays, there are so many couples that have met one another using a dating app. I personally feel that this has contributed to stronger relationships in general, and has also allowed people who may not have had the time to find a good relationship. For example, single mothers and fathers who have to work to support their kids have been able to meet significant others on a deeper level. Also, people who simply are not as extroverted have been able to work up the confidence to meet partners using a dating app. Now once in a relationship, i think technology has the ability to take away from relationships, especially if quality time with one another is lessened due to spending time on screens. As long as present time with one another is still met, than the screen time use isnt a huge deal. I think as long as people are weary about their time spent in front of screens, and make sure to keep their partner in mind, then it is ok. I think mostly of social media when i talk about this, simply because social media can so easily be used as a negative. Social media breeds constant comparisons of your life to someone elses. This can cause you to not be happy with what you have, and always want more. This is not a good idea for relationships. I think apps for entertainment can be good however because it provides a sense of entertainment for you arnd your partner. Maybe you want to sit down together and watch a movie on netflix, or you want to simply text a family member instead of call so you dont have to get up and walk away from your partner. Apps are simply a part of our world now, and there is always going to be negatives to anything in the world. To me, it really just depends on how you choose to use apps. In conclusion, i would say that dating apps are great for our generation. I think dating apps have done much more good than bad. They allow you to attempt to connect with someone without having to go out and physically meet them. It can be good to physically meet people, however it is not an option for everyone's lifestyle depending on the variables. So once again, just a great tool to have at our disposal as a society. Single parents simply are not going to get the chance to go out to populated places on their own and attempt to meet people. Even with this, they severly limiting their pool of people to choose from. With a dating app, there are so many more people at their disposal who they could meet. I am a huge proponent of dating apps, possibly because i met my wife on one.

And moreover, it's just that much easier for me to 'switch off' when listening to someone else read - particularly if what I'm listening to isn't capturing my attention. Oftentimes, when I'm listening to an audiobook, I'll find myself daydreaming about times I'd rather forget, or something bad that happened today, or my looming deadlines... I just can't concentrate fully on what I'm listening to if my mind is wandering. This isn't to say that audiobooks can't be tremendously useful, and I do use them occasionally. I mean, if I'm driving, I can't even pretend that it isn't ten times safer for me to be listening to someone else read instead of trying to read myself. On my commute to and from school, I often find that listening to John Scalzi narrate his own audiobooks is enjoyable - even though I don't think I get as much out of the audiobooks as I do from reading them my own.

Its has encouraged early retirements across the league. I think MMA is about as extreme of a sport as there is. This one should be closely monitored for conditions like CTE and a whole host of other issues from getting hit in other places not just during their fights but during practice. It is literally their job to get beaten up. I would assume that we will see significant long term damage to these fighters, worse then what we see with older boxers. It is still their right to fight as long as it legally sanctioned. I cant stress this enough though, while I think extreme sports should be left up to the decisions of the athletes, I also think they should be given all the relevant data that goes along with their desired field.

{"text": "For example, we might oppose the hunting of whales, yet if a small community of indigenous people are only able to survive through the winter by sustainably killing one whale per year for meat and blubber, then we should not let our idealistic view of noble, graceful animals distract from the needs of real, living persons. As for the other question of people preferring to save their own dog, rather than the life of a foreign tourist, I cannot really judge anyone too harshly. How many of us could truly say that we would prefer to save a stranger over a family member? Wouldn't you prefer to save your estranged uncle even if it meant allowing two or more other people to die as a result? People are close to their pets, and treat them as family, so it is not surprising, or unethical, for us to prioritize their welfare. My main objection is treating the vague idea of an animal as more valuable than the real-world welfare of a human. This, of course, leads to more philosophical questions, and ones that I cannot give a confident answer to. For example, is it wrong to eat meat? Humans benefit from the nutritional density of meat, but animals are obviously harmed. I think that this is a personal choice that each individual should make, and one that they shouldn't make lightly. As long as they are aware of the fact that animals suffer for their convenience, then (with some serious regulations in place to prevent extreme suffering) they should be allowed to do so. Likewise, I tend to favor animal research for medical purposes, because ultimately, a lot more suffering is prevented than is caused. But, of course, I accept that this is not always a utilitarian calculation. Some may feel that it is wrong to deliberately harm an animal or a human, and I respect that opinion. In so many words, I can understand why people tend to favor the lives of highly-visible animals over the lives of unseen humans, but I do have to strenuously object.

What is happening in Afganistan is not exactly directly affecting the lives of every single American, so it is acceptable to simply not have heard about it. Not only this, but sometimes people may even choose to avoid news stories simply for peace of mind. So much of the news is negative, and if you are always reading it, it is impossible not to have a negative outlook on what is going on around you. I personally feel that it would be much easier to digest more news if there was more positive news.

Whether it is through protesting or simply emailing local government, people without a doubt can play a role in getting change to occur. The actual act itself of digesting news does not really have any effect though. I think some people simply feel better knowing all they can know, since the unknown can be scarier than the actual truth at times. So it is really different for everyone what engaging with news can do for you. If you feel that gaining the perspective from reading the news is positive enough, than it is a good thing to read it. If you feel like all the info is bogging down your mind and taking away from your ability to be present, it may be a good idea to either balance it or forgo it altogether.", "prompt_len": 1081, "label": "api"}

Russia stormed their country and prevented the attacks long enough for the USA to fight back and send troops into the country. The USA, Canada, Russia, and Africa fought back with all they force they could come up with, and knocked off Chiang Kai-Shek once and for all.

That's particularly the case since we have nurses' offices in schools that can easily provide free pads and tampons to students. I mean, it would be absurd for a school nurse to see a girl who is bleeding and not offer her a pad or tampon. So schools should just start finding the resources to provide free pads and tampons to students.

A dog also has a much lesser lifespan than a human and that may play a role in a human beings thoughts when it comes to these scenarios. Animal cruelty is absolutely disgusting and someone that participates in it should be in jail for at least 10 years in my opinion.

The 92nd little pig was actually the most talented of all when it came to building, and it was this talent that the pig hoped would bring its mother back to see him. This home appeared on magazines and blurbs, but still his mother was nowhere to be found. The next day there was another knock on the door. The little pig stood up to check who it was. It looked like the wolf, along with a couple of other wolves. The pig opened the door. 'Would you mind signing our petition to allow for wolves to have kids here. The county is not allowing for it and it troubles our heart.' The pig thought this was a good cause so signed without hesitation. 'I am sorry to hear about this wolves. I hope this signature helps!' The wolves scamper off. That night, another group of wolves come to the house with suitcases. 'Hello little pig! I am afraid your time is up here!

{"text": "I think there are many advantages to listening to an audio book in my personal opinion. Sometimes the reader's voice even ties into the book, and makes the book feel even more real. For example, if you listen to a harry potter book using audible, the voice matches that of the characters in harry potter. Its that british sounding voice. In addition to this, you are able to listen to the book in many more situations and places than you would be able to physically read a book. I can lay down in bed without having to sit up and listen to a book, or listen to a book while driving, or while cleaning up in the house, or even while taking the dogs for a walk. This makes it much easier to indulge yourself into a good book. I personally do not feel that there are any advantages to reading a book physically over listening. I think it is simply preference. Reading is more quiet and can allow some people the ability to immerse themselves a little more. However, i dont really find reading to have any advantages like audiobooks do, especially for efficiency. I am a huge fan of being efficient, and being able to listen while still working or doing other activities is the seller for me. You may even save money using an audiobook, as normally these are subscriptions and you can get titles for cheaper. I pay a monthly fee for a certain number of credits for my subscription, and normally one credit is the equivalent of one book. The monthly fee is only 15 dollars a month, so do the math on that. If your heavy into books, this is well worth it, not only for the books but for the service.

Search the library for whatever books you may be interested in, and even find books out that you may be interested in.

{"text": "Think about all of the relationships that have led to marriage that started on a dating website or an app like Tinder. Tinder and dating websites allow you to get to know someone and see if you're somewhat compatible without actually meeting. That first get together for a first date can be very nerve wracking. I know for me personally if I have been texting a girl or Face Timing her, the nerves are way less than if I'm going onto the date blind. These apps allow us to get to know someone and break the ice without the awkwardness of doing it in person. I have used dating apps before and I enjoy them. I find it so relaxing to just swipe right when I find a girl attractive. This gives her the idea that I find her attractive without me having to say anything. I also don't get the feeling of rejection if the girl never responds. I simply swipe right and just forget about it. I think that apps and dating websites are great for people that don't have a ton of confidence. I know that during my High School years I lacked confidence and would be so nervous to talk to a girl. It didn't even matter the topic, I'd be extremely nervous. These dating apps allow you to forego that and get to know a person without the face to face nerves. Are there nerves when you're FaceTiming or texting someone you're interested in? Of course. You don't want to embarrass yourself and say the wrong thing and ruin everything. But I'd much rather be embarrassed on one side of a telephone compared to being embarrassed in person. I also appreciate that dating apps allow people to be up front about what they're using them for. Some people use the apps looking for a relationship. Some are using the apps to just hook up. I find that refreshing because it allows you to really find what you're looking for, or at the very least search for it. I think in general dating apps and dating websites have had a positive affect on relationships. While I'm sure some people have had negative experiences using them, if I was a betting man I would say that the positive experiences greatly outweigh the negative ones.

{"text": "Mathematics helped lead me to computer science as I loved solving problems and learning formulas. I majored in Computer Science in college and work in that area now as a 30 year old. I knew that math was my favorite subject from a very early age. It was also one that came most naturally to me. I remember being in class and always finishing problems first. I remember never really struggling with anything math related besides artificial intelligence related calculus courses in college. So while math was my favorite subject, I think the thing that I took from school is to figure out what you're passionate about. Some people are passionate about school. Some people are passionate about sports. Some people are passionate about television. Whatever it is that you're passionate about, try to find a job related to it. I know from first hand experience that when your job involves something you're passionate about and something you love...it never really feels like a job. I look forward to going to work each day and tackling new projects. Maybe I'll outgrow that one day but inside I'm still that little kid that loves the feeling of solving a problem and getting it right. I also think there are many things that school teaches us that have a major affect on the rest of our lives. For example, we'd be lost without learning the English language. We wouldn't be able to communicate with one another. Without science we wouldn't understand how so many different things work including the human body and the brain. Without history, we'd make mistakes that could have been prevented. School also teaches us how to respect others and how to socialize with others. When we're in school we are surrounded by hundreds of our peers. When one child is speaking to the class, you don't hear the other children yelling or screaming or interrupting. That's because they would get in trouble for doing so. That's teaching a child respect for others. It's one of the most important things that you can learn in life. Respect for yourself and respect for others. School is such a valuable place. You learn essential things, you meet essential people and you grow and mature over time. School is important, so if you are a student, make sure that you take it seriously and enjoy it because it's done before you know it.", "prompt_len": 2310, "label": "api"}

{"text": "Assuming that we don't want to get into the business of banning sports that have been around for years, I think it's reasonable to use the most dangerous existing sports, as an upper limit on what is acceptable.

Some regulatory agency would have to be created to make these kinds of comparisons between sports, and to decide which ones are too dangerous to be allowed.

If deemed too high, the organization that created the sport would have to make changes to reduce the risk, or else competition in it would be prohibited. Once a sport is established, records would have to be kept of injuries and deaths, so that the risk could be calculated. A sport that exceeds the threshold, would be required to make changes to reduce the risk, or else it would be banned. This would apply to existing sports, as well as new ones. Sports are an inherently dangerous activity, and there is no way to eliminate all risk. However, it seems absurd to attempt to ban all dangerous sports, as some people have suggested, because this would begin a disturbing trend of government interference in our lives. The best approach is a rational, common-sense, empirical one, aiming to set a reasonable limit on the acceptable level of risk, and then to require that all sports stay below that level.

{"text": "I love using audiobooks because I can listen to them while I am laying down before I go to bed. I don't want to read in the dark obviously as that would do damage to my eyes. I also appreciate audiobooks as they allow people who can't read and people who can't see to be able to 'read' a book. Audiobooks also give me the option of speeding up the reading. So if I'm a poor reader I can get way more accomplished in a specific time period by listening to the book compared to actually reading it. I also find it very nice that audiobooks tend to be cheaper than physical books, especially the hardcover ones. We live in a digital world and I am fully invested in that. I will say that I do love holding a book for whatever reason. I like feeling the cover and the pages and also looking at pictures that are sometimes in the middle of the book. However, audiobooks are just more convenient. If I'm on a crowded bus or a crowded train and I have to stand, reading would be very difficult and also uncomfortable. I can put my headphones in and go to an app such as Audible or Chirpbooks and just tune everyone out and get the information from the book that way. I think there are pros and cons to both methods and also think they are useful in specific scenarios like the one I described above. I just prefer the convenience and the price of audibooks. They fit my needs and wants better when it comes to reading. I have read physical books and I have listened to many audiobooks.

{"text": "I think that is a personal choice that we make and that doesn't dictate whether we are good or bad citizens. News is also a very broad term. Some people follow political news. Some people follow sports news. I assume this topic relates to world news or local news and again I think that's a personal choice. I personally don't think the news is that valuable. Obviously there are certain times that you have to tune in such as a global pandemic like the Coronavirus. That type of news is essential to basically everyone in the country. We need to be up to date with that news because it can affect us and everyone around us in a negative way. I think that hearing stories about murder, robbery and things like that can put us in a negative mind space. That is why I try to avoid the news at all costs. When I hear something upsetting it usually makes me sad. If I avoid the news, I don't get sad as much because I don't hear or see as much upsetting information. Engaging in current events can be impactful depending on the person and the event. For example if someone sees an advertisement for a toy drive on the news and that causes them to donate toys then that helps. But I don't think the good outweighs the bad when it comes to the news. Most of the time the local news is highlighting sad stories and the national news is always filled with propaganda and false information on both sides. I think this way because over time the news has just turned me off and never made me want to watch it again. I hate the news. If something is very important I'll see it on social media or a family member will tell me about it.

The only difference I see between items such as tampons and pads and items such as soap is that tampons and pads are embarrassing to talk about and receive. I feel like tampons and pads have the same stigma that condoms have. They're items that are somewhat embarrassing to buy. And that's a shame.

Students also spend so much time thinking about their social life and worrying about their personal safety, rather than actually trying to learn, that they are too distracted and demoralized to learn very much of whatever their teachers arbitrarily decide to emphasize. I base this on my observations of the young, who I believe are getting a worse education than I did as a member of the previous generation, but also my own experiences. As it turns out, I learned very little in school in the conventional sense. My parents taught me to read and write; friends taught me how to do math;  and I spent copious amounts of time in the library and with our Encyclopedia Britannica, learning about history. Much of what I did learn in school, involved dubious socialization, self-defense, and wrong-headed political opinions, all of which were 'learning' that I could have done without.

They are all written to fill a specific part of the horror movie. We're used to that formula though so I feel from a society standpoint that such roles are okay in that genre. It can be okay sometimes to have stereotypes. The characters must be at least funny or have something about them that makes them charming or likable. Then you can look past these shortcomings. If they are just flat characters then it makes it hard to be able to do that. Media has evolved when it comes to portraying stereotypes. Remakes are being done where once weak female characters are now tougher. Even the infamous Psycho death scene was changed for the show Bates Motel. The iconic female victim switched to a male victim in the shower. I personally don't have a problem with stereotypes. Sometimes I may cringe when I see them but that's part of it.
